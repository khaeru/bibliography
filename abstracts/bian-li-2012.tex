The Chinese General Social Survey (CGSS), launched jointly since 2003 by Hong Kong University of Science and Technology and Renmin University, continued to be jointly organized by the two institutions in the 2004, 2005, 2006, and 2008 surveys. This article introduces the background of the first phase of the CGSS, and describes the research agenda, sample designs, and fieldwork implementation strategies. It also provides an assessment of data quality for different types of fieldwork implementation through scholarly networks, government, and survey research firms.
