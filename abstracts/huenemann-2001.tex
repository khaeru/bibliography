Since 1980, the elasticities of transport volume to \{GDP\} in China have often been less than 1.0, with some downward trend. This pattern is partially explained by the coastal concentration of growth, the structural shift of \{GDP\} toward sectors that less transport-intensive, and other factors. However, petroleum consumption data and other information strongly suggest that the published transport statistics for road traffic in the 1990s fail to capture a significant portion of the actual ton-kilometers and passenger-kilometers, and the problem seemsto get worse as the decade progresses.
