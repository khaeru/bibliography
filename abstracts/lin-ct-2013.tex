Understanding the life-cycle private cost (LCPC) of the hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) is important for market feasibility analysis. An \{HEV\} \{LCPC\} model was established to evaluate \{HEV\} market prospects in China compared with traditional internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEV). The Kluger HV, a full-hybrid \{HEV\} sports utility vehicle (SUV), aimed at the Chinese market, was simulated as the 2010 model's technology details were well publicized. The \{LCPC\} of the Kluger \{HV\} was roughly the same (about 1.06 times) as that of its comparable \{ICEV\} (Highlander SUV). This aligns with other compact and midsize \{HEV\} cars (e.g., Toyota Prius, Honda Civic and Toyota Camry HEV) in China. With oil prices predicted to rise in the long-term, the advantage of \{HEVs\} energy saving will partly compensate the high manufacturing costs associated with their additional motor/battery components. Besides supporting technology development, enabling policy should be implemented to introduce \{HEV\} technology into taxi fleets and business cars. This technology's cost-competitiveness, compared with traditional ICEVs, is advantageous for these higher mileage vehicles.
