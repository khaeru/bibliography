This paper presents an empirical analysis of the statistical bias resulting from the endogeniety of vehicle specific attributes in econometric models of household vehicle utilization. Using data from a recent U.S. household survey, both corrected and uncorrected vehicle utilization models are estimated. A comparison of these estimation results reflects the substantial bias in model coefficients, price elasticities and income elasticities that can result if the endogeneity of vehicle specific attributes is not considered.
