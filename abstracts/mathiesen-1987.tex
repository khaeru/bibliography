The Walrasian equilibrium problem is cast as a complementarity problem, and its solution is computed by solving a sequence of linear complementarity problems (SLCP). Earlier numerical experiments have demonstrated the computational efficiency of this approach. So far, however, there exist few relevant theoretical results that characterize the performance of this algorithm.
