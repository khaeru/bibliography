This article investigates how the integration of urban planning and transport policies has been pursued in key case study cities since the early 1990s. Focusing on the underlying institutional arrangements, it examines how urban policymakers, professionals, and stakeholders have worked across disciplinary silos, geographic scales, and different time horizons. The article draws on expert interviews, examination of policy and planning documents, and review of key literature from 2 cities, London and Berlin. The article presents 2 main findings. First, it identifies converging trends as part of the institutional changes that facilitated planning and policy integration. Second, it argues that rather than building on either more hierarchical or networked forms of integration, planning and policy integration are linked to a hybrid model that combines hierarchy and networks.
