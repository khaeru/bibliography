This paper presents an analysis of automobile ownership in urban households of the six Yugoslav republics and for the years 1973, 1978, and 1983. The analysis is based on a simple dichotomous probit model, the only explanatory variable being household income. The model proved to be adequate in describing the empirical data. In spite of the large socio-economic differences between the Yugoslav republics, our analysis shows that there are certain common tendencies in automobile ownership.
