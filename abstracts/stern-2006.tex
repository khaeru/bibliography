Global anthropogenic sulfur emissions increased until the late 1980s. Existing estimates for 1995 and 2000 show a moderate decline from 1990 to 1995 or relative stability throughout the decade. This paper combines previously published data and new econometric estimates to show a 22\% decline over the decade to a level not seen since the mid-1960s. The decline is evident in North America, Western and Eastern Europe, and in the last few years in East and South Asia. If this new trend is maintained, local air pollution problems will be ameliorated but global warming may be somewhat exacerbated.
