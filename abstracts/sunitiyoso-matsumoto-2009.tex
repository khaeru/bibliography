This study attempts to apply an agent-based approach to modelling a social dilemma of travel mode choice considering psychological and sociological aspects. A traveller is modelled to have expectations, which shows the travellerâ€™s beliefs about the influence of other group members on his action, as decision-making rules. Social interaction using a group-based interaction is hypothesized to be important. We apply an imitation game based on social learning mechanisms to the model. Two kinds of mechanism are used: payoff-biased and conformist transmission. The model reveals the conditions that make cooperation as a possible outcome are optimistic bandwagon expectations, group-based interactions, and strong conformist transmissions.
