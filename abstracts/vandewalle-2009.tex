What should we do to raise the quality of signal processing publications to an even higher level? We believe it to be crucial to maintain the precision in describing our work in publications, ensured through a high-quality reviewing process. We also believe that if the experiments are performed on a large data set, the algorithm is compared to the state-of-the-art methods, the code and/or data are well documented and available online, we will all benefit and make it easier to build upon each other's work. It is a clear win-win situation for our community: we will have access to more and more algorithms and can spend time inventing new things rather than recreating existing ones.
