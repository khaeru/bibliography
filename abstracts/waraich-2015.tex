In contrast to aggregated macroscopic models of traffic simulation, multi-agent microscopic models, such as MATSim, enable modeling of individual behavior and facilitate more detailed traffic analysis. However, such detailed modeling also leads to an increased computational burden, such that simulation performance becomes critical.
