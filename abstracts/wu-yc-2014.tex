This paper analyzes the public content on the websites of targeted universities in North America and English speaking-Europe to examine their commitment to education in sustainable transportation. Analyzing about 5000 shows that most of them were worth three credits, more sustainable transportation courses were offered to graduate students than to undergraduates, lecturing was the most common teaching method, and, on average, North American universities offered more sustainable transport courses than did their European counterparts. Finally, the environmental issue was emphasized and discussed far more than the economic and social issues in the sustainable transport context.
