In recent years, a smart phone has become a useful platform to easily access banking services. However, compared to regular Internet banking using a personal computer, the adoption of a smart phone for Internet banking might be more vulnerable with regard to security. In this study, we first identify two dimensions: security and usability, and empirically test their role as determinants that affect Internet banking use with a smart phone (IBUS). Second, we investigate whether or not security and usage can possibly interact with each other to influence IBUS. Results indicate: (1) security issues were found to be a significant determinant of IBUS; (2) Perceived Usefulness (PU) and Perceived Ease of Use (PEU) as usability had significant effects on IBUS; (3) PU and PEU moderated the relation between users' perception toward security and IBUS; and (4) Users' perception toward security moderated the relation between PU/PEU and IBUS.
